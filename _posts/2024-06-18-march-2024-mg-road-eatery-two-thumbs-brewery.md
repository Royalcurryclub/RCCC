Magnificent March Muching

##### Two Thumbs has previously earnt the wrath of the RCCC by closing early when we’ve been determined to get on the loud-mouth soup. Fortunately, this time, the place was pumping when we ventured in for some warmups in the March sun. Then we wandered down the road to the recently opened MG Road Eatery for the traditional March Maharajah birthday celebration (and of course the March visitation). Our Best Dressed winner from last month’s awards dinner MW, had dragged along his cousin who was visiting from Old Blighty. Hopefully the new curryhouse on the block would not disappoint our overseas visitor…


##### The well-prepared amongst the hungry throng had already perused the extensive menu online and made some informed choices. All that was tossed out the window on arrival as we tried to navigate the QR menus on the tables that were different to the menus online and different again to the menus up the wall behind the kitchen. Fortunately, the owner of the fine establishment spotted our confused looks, brought over some generously sized Kingfishers and gave us the inside scoop on the menu. He also brought over some poppadoms and 3 pots of intriguing sauces which are always a sure-fire way to a good curry score. Kizih Paratha was chosen by three distinguished members after the staff recommendation, and it certainly brought out several jealous looks when it arrived. One particularly enamoured individual named it the Dish of the Year. Another pronounced the Jalfrezi as in the Top 3 he’d ever had, so high praise for the curry was plentiful. It must be said that the Maharajah had craftily selected one of the few venues in Christchurch Currydom that didn’t serve a vindaloo and so avoided eating one as is the tradition on ones birthday. Well Played Raj! There was also a massive cabinet full of sweet treats in another part of the restaurant so that alone warrants a repeat visit.

##### For daring to suggest a Pepper Bridge type visitation was on the cards, RT was awarded the CoTM despite being given the FOMO trophy. The actual CoTM trophy will hopefully make an appearance soon for a worthy winner. Trophy confusion aside, this was an absolute banger of a visitation with curry score of 4.8/5. A couple thirsty Munchers slid back to Two Thumbs for some more sophisticated suds supping and telling tall tales to round out what was a very memorable night.


##### We will be back.

Service: 3.8/5

Food: 4.8/5
