Only the Chosen Few – part Deux.

It was another intimate session as we got the RCCCs first visitation of 2024 underway from the lofty heights of Mr Brightside Rooftop Bar. While numbers were a bit sparse with holidays and post beerfest hangovers in play, a hard-core group of stalwarts took in the sights and soaked up the holiday vibes while paying quite ridiculous beer prices. Then it was onto Mumbaiwala for what has become our traditional venue to start off the new curry year.

Making up for the piss-poor feedback from members at Mumbaiwala, there were the 3 field trip reports turned in by our roving curry ambassadors. We learnt that curry night at the Copper Pot in Westport mostly means chips and some indeterminate meat batter. We also learnt despite being halfway around the world, the universal colour of bloody hot curry is that lovely glow-in-the-dark red colour at Maa Indian in Beverly, and that JBs RCCC blazer has probably accumulated more air miles than Taylor Swift’s private jet. And finally, we learnt that if we ever venture as far south as Bombay Palace in Frankton, RCCC needs will be catered for. It had good bhajis on the menu and the chicken tika had some decent kick – worthy of a solid 4 out of 5 on the RCCC curry score. For what it’s worth, the portion sizes at Mumbaiwala were thought to be a bit stingy, so we’ll have to head back some time and verify.

After dinner, further overpriced beverages were sought at Mr Brightside, which given the lack of having to get up for work the following day, which made for very relaxing end to the visitation.
