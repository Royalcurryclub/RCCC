Flash the cash at the gash or a futile flutter on the fillies?

The Jolly Poacher was pre-earthquake favourite with its central location and a tendency to close very late, hitting the spot for many. It’s back, so the somewhat depleted RCCC regiment decamped to salubrious surrounds of Victoria Street to see what the fuss was all about – and eat some curry of course.

Liquid libations liberated and it was onto Gunpowder Indian Restaurant and Bar. We had visited this establishment in a previous guise at least twice before so would the curry and the service be up to snuff? The staff were certainly impressed with the blazers (who can resist a man in uniform?) and dished out free chocolate naans and ice cream. The naans were delicious but Chicken Jalfrezi was found to be underwhelming with too much cream action and not enough pepper. Fortunately, our resident Jalfrezi fiend RT was not in attendance, so the RCCC gentlemen were spared the sight of one of their own in tears of disappointment. The extensive beer selection was also mentioned. Curry score was a middling 3.8/5 but high marks for the service dragged up the overall score to a respectable 8.3/10.

During the meal the looming difficult decision of the day was discussed: Hiding out at Calendar Girls putting notes through the letterboxes or off to the Casino to lose next week’s pay check on the nags. Those crafty lads of the RCCC certainly covered their tracks well as digital evidence is lacking at this time – nice work!

Service: 4.5/5

Curry: 3.8/5

Total:8.3/10
