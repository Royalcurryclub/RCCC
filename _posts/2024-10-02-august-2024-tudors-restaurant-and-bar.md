Buffet &gt; Banquet ?

The Maharajah thought a shake-up was required for the August visitation so ordered his hungry knights down to ye olde Tudor’s Restaurant and Bar for Thursday Curry Night. In a first for the RCCC, and what every wet dream of the Banquet Bros must be like, this was a buffet type arrangement with loads of Indian, Sri Lankan and Nepalese dishes on offer. And salads, breads and even desserts for the brave.

After fiddling with some dusty suits of armour and clearing the dusty throats with the Kingfisher included in the buffet, the hard task of narrowing down the choices of dishes began. One of the early winners was the beef vindaloo but sadly its popularity proved its downfall and those prone to dithering, had to make do with a sweet n sour pork instead. There was also the RCCC favourite, goat on the menu as well as lots of poppadoms, pickles and all the usual accoutrements that make up a good curry munching. The Raj made special mention of the samosas for their petite deliciousness and different types of rice were also noted.

The scores on the RCCC curryometer were on the lower side but the feedback seemed to be positive from the crew in attendance so maybe the curryometer needs a Ctrl-Alt-Delete. Possibly the Banquet Bros have hacked the website so that we stay away from the Buffet competition. Regardless, lots of fun was had by all and its always good to change things up once in a while.
