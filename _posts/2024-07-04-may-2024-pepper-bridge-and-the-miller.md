Drier than Gandhi’s Flip-Flop

The old saying goes: Nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. To that we can now add that Pepper Bridge will be dry…First off, we gathered at The Miller for some delightful Murphy’s Stout and people watching. A youthful throng of runners were assembled across the road from the pub, fresh from chasing the runners high. We watched, smug in the knowledge that nothing beats the highs (and sometimes lows) of chasing curry in Christchurch.

Pepper Bridge has shifted premise since our last official visitation, fortunately the Trimble construction support team has been doing regular Thursday recces so we knew standards had not dropped in the move. Unfortunately, the move necessitated a re-application of a liquor licence and so this was another bloody dry visitation! This is despite the Pepper Bridge website saying otherwise.

There were some curry callouts including the mushroom mata and garlic cheese naan being very good and attractively priced. The bhaji was a bit below par though and there was a general feeling that the heat could have been turned up a notch – something to bear in mind for a revisit. This will need to be when the booze situation has been rectified as this is no doubt affecting current patronage. It was so quiet that you could hear a mouse pi$$ing on a cotton ball. It’s amazing the noise and atmosphere a couple people enjoying their meal with a beer generates. It certainly makes for a more enjoyable night and also draws others into the curry house.

The Maharajah should have been awarded the CoTM award for yet again dragging the Munchers to a dry Pepper Bridge (this being our 3rd visitation). However, the trophy ended up being awarded to JB for his scandalous suggestion that we not drink the illicit hip flask booze that we had snuck in. That PC nonsense has no place in a drinking club that has a curry problem. Then it was back to The Miller for some more loud-mouth soup to solve all the problems of the world.

Service: 3.8/5

Curry: 4.6/5

Total: 8.4/10

Pepper Bridge, 300 Lincoln Rd
