Superb.

Brilliant work from the Raj, it was a cracking day and great mix of activities and venues that just kept giving all day long. Reuniting with the mystery diner at the Afghan was just one of many highlights of the day – the “random” stig who turned up and kept our kart racing egos in check – Paul of Wigram Brewery fame’s epic yarns, his down to earth style and his description of Spruce beer drinkers to one of its few die hard fans – The hottest starter salad you’ll find east of Delhi wolfed down by the group like ravenous vegans.
