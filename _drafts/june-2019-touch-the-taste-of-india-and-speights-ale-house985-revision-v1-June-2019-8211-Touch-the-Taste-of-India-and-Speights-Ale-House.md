Worth the wait.

The RCCC members enjoyed some genuine Indian snacks brought all the way over from India by Mr D; the butterscotch chili biscuits were an interesting mix of sweet butterness and heat! The members were also appreciative of the garments brought back by the aforementioned Mr D and no doubt these will be making regular appearances in future events.

As for the meal, strong performance on taste and value for money. With so many northern Indian style establishments, it is always nice to have a southern Indian influence on the menu. Those that had starters were pleased with the Pakoras, Lamb Chop Sizzle, however the Bhaji was a little dry. The mains, Kadai, Saag, Madras and more, were all tasty with a bit of kick and polished off quickly. The only negative on the experience was that there was only one poor chef in the kitchen, which meant that it took a while for our meals to come out. Saying that though, he did a valiant job of getting everyoneâ€™s order spot on.
