Curry re-fills? Yes please!

Best value banquet of any curry house so far, $35 pp with massive entree enough to satisfy any normal human and then 3 curries and naan with free refills! Nice to see new unknown curries \[Chicken Afghani, Handi Lamb\] on the menu. Shame they didn’t ask for spice preference when taking orders. Staff were excellent and happy to have a laugh with us (or at us?). The pre/post drinks at the Foundry made us feel old, but good to see what the kids are up to nowadays!

Scores on the Doors:  
Service – 4.4/5  
Food – 4/5  
**Total – 8.4/10**
