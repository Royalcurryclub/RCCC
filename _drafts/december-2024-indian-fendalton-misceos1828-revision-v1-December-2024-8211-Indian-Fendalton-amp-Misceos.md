Cougar Deserts and Just Deserts

After a five and a half year absence a thirsty RCCC contingent mobbed up and took up their stations in the salubrious surrounds of Fendalton. First to Misceos for some sideways stares and drooling…over the generously sized and good selection of beers. There were the usual 7pm grumbles but at the appointed hour it was time to head over to Indian Fendalton.

TK bought some wearables from his magic box of dress-up and the Festive Seven got into the Currymas spirit. The Maharajah had thrown on his finest white shirt for the occasion, which is pretty brave when imbibing the hot stuff. The finery was however wasted on the Fendalton cougars who were nowhere to be seen on the balmy Thursday evening. The curry scored a solid 4.3 on the curry-o-meter for a pretty good feed and the service was a pleasing 4.3 too.

The Maharajah was obviously feeling aggrieved at the lack of cougars and choose to take his wrath out on the hapless RT who had suggested the visitation and then went MIA on the appointed Thursday. For his crimes against Currydom he was duly awarded the recently resurfaced CoTM trophy and the FOMO trophy for good measure – just deserts indeed!

Service: 4.3/5

Curry: 4.3/5

Total: 8.6/10
