The Maharajah had deemed this month an awards month, and so there was a large turnout with many of the RCCC Gentlemen expecting to collect awards and trinkets from Our Curry Leader.

A challenge had been issued several months back for photos of RCCC Gentlemen in their blazers doing gentlemanly things. While there were the predictable work photos, one member definitely took the challenge to heart. Seems he didn’t take his blazer off all year and submitted a number of dodgy looking pictures. The Best Dressed Award – MW, in a RCCC first, a RCCC gentleman respledent in his blazer on a boat pic.

While there were three establishments visited in the last year that scored a mighty 4.7/5 on the curry’o meter, there could be only One. Unsurprisingly, the Maharajah decided it was his local, that deserved the new award. The Golden Naan Award – Saket Prebbleton.

Curry Club for Life Award (aka Bros before Hoes) – RT for attending a RCCC visitation while his wife was going into theatre to have an operation. He may yet live to regret this decision…

Pogo Stick of Shit Award – You might need clean up the nastiest turd in existence after a night on the curry and beers, or it could be a metaphorical turd storm that you’ve gotten yourself into. You’re going to need the biggest plunger around to clean up the shit – RT for living his Bros before Hoes philosophy.

With awards out the way it was time to fill our curry-holes. The naan was repeated called out in the monthly feedback: “Best naan I’ve had”, “The best naan bread in town”, Delicious naan” etc so kudos to the chef and staff for impressing a tough and discerning audience. There was the traditional curry auction when the mains arrived, but once the steaming bowls of goodness had made their way to their hungry owners, the curry was universally praised. “Prawn Sagwalla was hot and spicy, just how I like it”, “A Madras fit for a birthday” and “Bloody Great Jalfrezi, perfectly spiced”. There was also some good banter with staff who provided great service. And if we didn’t already have enough reasons to go back – Kingfishers were $9, bargain!

Despite threats of a warm ice cream dessert for birthday boy SC, we decided to move back to Sideline Sports Bar for some dessert beers and people-watching. Not before some parking lot pile driving on the RCCC Pogo Stick by our Jimmy Saville look-alike ensured some strange looks from passersby. Top marks for this visitation!

Service: 4.5/5

Food: 4.6/5
