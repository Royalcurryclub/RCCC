March Madness

The Maharajah decreed that the March visitation would take place at the new Saket Prebbleton which was a mere stagger and a couple farts from the Raj palace. There was the serious business of a couple birthdays vidaloos to be enjoyed and a special wedding vindaloo for MW to celegrate his upcoming celebration. But first it was time to relax in the summer sun at the Good Home while tall tales of motorcycle machismo were told and refreshing pints were sunk.

Saket in Edgeware is a much loved and and often visited establishment so it would be interesting to see how the new Saket measured up. The menu looked pretty much the same

Scores on the Doors:

Service: 3.8/5

Food: 3.7/5

Total: 7.5/10  
Saket Prebbleton, 563 Springs Road
