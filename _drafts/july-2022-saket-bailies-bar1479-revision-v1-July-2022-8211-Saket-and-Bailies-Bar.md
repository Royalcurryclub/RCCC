Mid-Winter Munching and Merriment.

It was back to very familiar territory after a couple experimental visitations in recent months, for the now annual RCCC Mid-Winter celebration at Saket. The theme for the evening was “Seven” as decreed by The Maharaja which was sure to make the mandatory Secret Santa present session, interesting. Warm up beverages were held at Bailies Bar where the allure of sparkling conversation and dodgy gifts had ensured a health turnout of RCCC members. There was also the hilarious game of “spot the RCCC stickers” that were dotted around from our last visit to the pub.

Onto Saket and it was immediately obvious of the high standing and regard the club now commands, the tables were already set up in formation and the staff poised at the beer tap, ready to slake the thirst of the assembled throng. The Banquet Bros received a surprise visit from our now Nelson based RCCC stalwart MR who immediate seized the <del>bull</del> goat by the horns and negotiated a cracking banquet deal for the whole table. Goat Rogan Josh, Chicken Jalfrezi, Chicken Achari and Mixed Tandoor Platter soon made an appearance thanks to the always accommodating and attentive staff who also keep the hydration levels high. The goat was noted to be particular superb and repeated pleasantly for many hours.

With full bellies and protesting belts it was onto the presents which have improved over the years it must be said. Several gifts from years gone made a re-appearance including the much lusted after and often referenced, mindful origami book. This was handy as it allowed some newer members be anointed with the ultimate RCCC accolade – an RCCC origami name.

The FOMO trophy made an appearance and was duly awarded to HO for many transgressions of many things but the nifty Lego present he had acquired in the Secret Santa session, seemed cheer him up. Then it was back to Bailies for a liquid debrief to wrap up what was great craic and mostly great presents!
