Add to the must return list.

The banquet was a feast and several of us didn’t manage to finish it all. One lucky member was the beneficiary of the feast and left with a decent doggy bag that should have lasted for a few extra meals. Well done to our chief negotiator Mike, for once again negotiating a different banquet combo than the one advertised, although his skills are slipping because they charged us an extra dollar for the change to take into account the additional meat curry. The medium/hot curry that we ordered was in fact, hot. Absolutely beaut curry and enjoyed the friendly service too. Add to the must return list.
