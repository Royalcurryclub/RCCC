A surprise hit.

It was a quiet turnout from the RCCC members for some reason with only three enthusiastic curry devotees turning up for the monthly get together, pity for them because they missed a wee gem of a curry. Masla Own was a surprise hit for me, I was expecting a run of the mill standard curry fare but the menu was decent and more importantly the food tasted great. Clink is always good value for a cosy pub that offers decent beer and a place for a chat. I have it on good authority that the Maharajah will be doing a re-run of the curry house later in 2019
