Good value.

One of the menu choices was a TDH curry, which according to google is an abbreviation for itallian “Testa di Hazzo”. One brave member tried it out, even after the waiter said that he wouldn’t recommend it – apparently it was “salty”. The Sidleline Sports Bar was good fun, you cant go wrong with cheap beer, leaners, pool and a band playing in the background
