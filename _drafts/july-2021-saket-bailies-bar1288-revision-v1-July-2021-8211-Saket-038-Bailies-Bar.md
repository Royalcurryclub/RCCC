Cracker.

Baillies always for the win, esp on Canada Day. Saket was ok – service was relaxed, happy for us to square up the tables, food was alright – goat curry was friggin hot. Secret santa game all round was high. Great night out.

Questionable taste in music, origami and a highly desirable new trophy introduced. what a cracker of an evening for the annual mid-winter RCCC Christmas party. The members put some thought into the ‘red and black’ themed secret Santa gifts. Saket were great in terms of moving the tables around for us to accommodate the large group. Goat curry was friggin hot. Canada Day was celebrated at Baillies Bar, the moose knuckle is something that wont be forgotten in a hurry. Not too sure if TK’s son will look at him in the same way again.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 4.2/5  
Food: 4.0/5  
**Total: 8.2/10**
