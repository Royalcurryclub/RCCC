Excellent value with the GrabOne banquet deal

Pros: The grab one banquet deal was excellent value and very filling. The Entrees Samosa, Onion Bhaji and Tandoori Chicken with sauces were very tasty. The flavour of my Chicken Anaari was good and naan big and crunchy. Service was good and the restaurant itself was nice. Cons: I found the spiciness of the curry to very low to non-existent and the garlic naan was also basically a plain naan flavourwise.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service – 3.8/5  
Food – 3.4/5  
**Total – 7.2/10**
