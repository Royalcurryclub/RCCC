Meaty expectationsâ€¦satisfied?

It was a lower than average turnout for this RCCC outing as members were all over the world/country (UK, Thailand, Rarotonga, Ohakune, Auckland and Wellington) but it was good to see those travelling members check-in on the night with photos of the curry that they were having. As for Bolina, despite hesitation regarding a vegetarian only restaurant, it was quite good, a refreshing change to the norm, lots of locals and the curry had heaps of flavour. The mushroom and onion curry exceeded meaty expectations, onion bhaji were the some of the best, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Great naan too. The sweets selection is impressive, although some are definitely an acquired taste.  
All in all, highly recommended and very good value for money.
