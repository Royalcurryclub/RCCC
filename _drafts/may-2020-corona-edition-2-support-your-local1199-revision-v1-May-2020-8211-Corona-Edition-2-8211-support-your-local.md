Can I get a hallelujah please!

Were into level 3 this month, and still only able to convene a virtual RCCC meeting. However, this month RCCC members rejoiced as they were able to rushed out and order their favourite curries from their favourite local takeaways. Top marks all round for the fine flavours, with some establishments being recommended for a revisit, and good laughs on the video call after.
