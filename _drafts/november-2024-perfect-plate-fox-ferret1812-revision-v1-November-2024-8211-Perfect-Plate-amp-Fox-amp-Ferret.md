Suns Out, Buns Out

Given mall based curryhouses are pretty popular and we’ve visited several in the last 7 years, it’s surprising we haven’t visited the Palms before. To rectify that, 8 RCCC members dodged the strung out Shirleyites and opened up the account at the Fox &amp; Ferret. There were some sights to be seen given the sunny classic beer drinking weather and those member who got dreessed up were defintely wishing they wore shorts. The only downside was the rather eye watering beer prices at the Fox, although some of the craftier members had arrived early enough to hit Happy Hour prices – Huzzah!

In typical fashion there was much reluctance to leave our sunny perch but at the appointed hour we trundled off to Perfect Plate. The Jalfrezi was said to be more medium than medium hot, but everyone cleaned up their plates so that speaks to how good the spicy fare was. On the starter and accoutrement front, the Roti was bloody great, and the Onion Bhaji was very tasty. Service was friendly and attentive but there was the reappearance of the old curry auction, which knocked a couple points off the service score. Prices were pretty reasonable so it’s definitely a place that offers good value and a solid curry.

The current holder of the FOMO trophy, KS was away, no doubt washing his nuts in the bowl as is his wont, and with the CoTM trophy currently AWOL, the traditional monthly awards were a non-event. Despite this, spirits were high with the prospect of the RCCC Annual Outing at the end of November. A couple unsatiated punters slunk back to the Fox for a nightcap to round out a cracking night out.

Service: 4.0/5

Curry: 3.8/5

Total: 7.8/10
