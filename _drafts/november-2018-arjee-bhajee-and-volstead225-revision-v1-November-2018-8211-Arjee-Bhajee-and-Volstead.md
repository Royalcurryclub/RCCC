Should have ordered hotter.

Grabone vouchers nabbed for this monthâ€™s club meeting. Menu very limited compared to previously visited establishments. Food was ok and the service was friendly. It had been a very long time since many of the attendees had visited Volstead; a long overdue visit. Beers were raised with a nuptial announcement!

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 4/5  
Food: 3.8/5  
**Total: 7.8/10**

Arjee Bhajee, 13 Riccarton Road
