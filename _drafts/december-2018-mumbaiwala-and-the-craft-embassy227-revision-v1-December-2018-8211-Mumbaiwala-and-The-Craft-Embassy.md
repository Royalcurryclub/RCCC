I’d like to try the puffed rice millet curry for breakfast!

Great turnout for the end of year awards club meeting, welcoming back a couple of OG members. Congratulations to: MD for the Best Dressed award, representing the RCCC in New Zealand and Las Vegas; RT for the Hottest Curry award, while raising money for the scooter race; and TK for the Official Fish Slayer award, in recognition for the biggest, the smallest, the greatest quantity and the most different species during this year’s Annual Outing.

The Maharaja selected a great range of dishes off the menu which were shared by the table. All were devoured, with the Cauliflower Manchurian noted by some as a particular highlight. The service did a great job keeping up with the drinks. The Craft Embassy was a good pre/post drink selection, with members thoroughly enjoying the varied beer selection. Despite late night Lime scooter shenanigans, the only ill-effects of the end of year hurrah were a few hazy heads the next morning.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 4.3/5  
Food: 4/5  
**Total: 8.3/10**
