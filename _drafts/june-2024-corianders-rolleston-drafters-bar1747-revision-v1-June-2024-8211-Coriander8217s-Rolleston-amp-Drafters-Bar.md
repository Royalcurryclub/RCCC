The Tale of Two Cities

After a couple recent painful revisitations (ahem Pepper Bridge anyone?), it was time to venture to the Town of the Future aka Rolleston for a first visit. A decision no doubt influenced by promises of awesome curry from SC and a sizeable contribution to our Benevolent Maharajah’s ponzi fund. First though, the thirsty throng had to slake their thirsty at Drafters Bar after the long trek to the wop wops.

There are now 5 Coriander’s in Christchurch and surrounds, which is a testament to solid formula they have hit on. It keeps the punters happy and coming back for more. The 11 RCCC members who fronted were treated to the usual Coriander’s quality food and hospitality. Lamb kadai and the Special kebabs were called out for special mention, as was the portion sizing, which is alway good thing when so many have travelled so far and worked up a good appetite. The decor also seemed to resonate with the Raj as he plotted the theme for the mid-Winter visitation in July.

On the other side of the world our self-proclaimed globe-trotting curry reviewer MD, was in Azafran in Broomfield, Colorado checking out the latest in personal weaponry and conducting his own re-visitation, the 3rd in 9 months apparently. He started off with the lip numbing and sweat inducing goodness that is firecracker chicken, paired with wine for a change. His main meal of choice was goat, not just any standard goat, this was goat on the bone – fancy AF! Service was adjudged to be very attentive. Almost as attentive as when one waves notes at scantily clad ladies (or men) in various darkened establishments but those comments are probably from his notes on the after-dinner festivities…

Despite the perfect 10 score from the US of A Muncher, the NZ visitation dragged things down a bit, but was still lots of fun. Always good times when the RCCC is in town.

Service: 3.4/5

Curry: 4.0/5

Total: 7.4/10
