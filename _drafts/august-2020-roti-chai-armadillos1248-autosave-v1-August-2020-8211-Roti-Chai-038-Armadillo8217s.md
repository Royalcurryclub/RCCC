Great banquet.

Good atmosphere, beers and meat raffle at Armadillos? Check Banquet option at restaurant? Check, and at 32 bucks pp, and unlimited refills on literally any food ordered, fuckin yes check. Food any good? Shit yes, some of the best starters of a long long time, and the curries were tasty. Service very friendly.

It was a case of one mouthful too much. It brings back memories of Monty Pythons “go on, its wafer thin, have one more bite”.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 5.0/5  
Food: 5.0/5  
**Total: 10.0/10**

Roti Chai, 29 Ensign St
