And Now for Something Completely Different

In a break from tradition, the April visitation did not start at a local watering-hole, tavern or pub, instead we started at new venue on the scene, Trev’s Man Cave. Whether it was too many bevvies at Two Thumbs Brewery at the previous visitation or just sheer reckless disregard for his safety once his wife was found out the Curry Crew had been invited home. There was no going back. Given previous efforts for birthdays and RCCC trips it was no surprise that all the stops had been pulled out – Trev’s Man Cave has got it going on! It was also fairly evident by the grumbles as our 7pm dining period approached, that everyone to a man, would have happily flagged dinner and carried on the beery business of boozing and bullshit.

Corianders is one of those solid and dependable type places where it does what says on the tin. Service this time was a bit pedestrian and included the usual curry lottery, but it made for entertaining banter and kept everyone on their toes. Curry was actually very good and rated a 4.5 /5 of the RCCC curry scores which is right near the top of the list. The Jalfrezi was absolutly banging with perfect medium hotness and sumptious flavour.

There is a vague recollection of the Maharajah being awarded one or both trophies for chosing a child’s birthday over Curry Club, and if he wasn’t, he should have been… After dinner there was defitely some keenness to return to the Cave for more vexillology and band poster discussions. But, fortunately good sense won out and the members slipped off into the night with much dusting of the crops as they went. There are plans afoot to have a round two at the Cave – I’m frothing at the prospect.

Service: 3.8/5

Curry: 4.5/5

**Total: 8.3/10**

Coriander’s Sumner, 11A Wakefield Ave
